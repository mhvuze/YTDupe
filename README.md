# YTDupe

YouTube doesn't allow to upload duplicates which is annoying if you regularly announce your Twitch streams on your channel by publishing a short, usually identical info video.

Sick of re-rendering your video for the 2237th time? Just drag and drop your file on this tiny app and you are good to go.

It simply adds one single nullbyte to the file lel. Works fine for my h264 mp4s
